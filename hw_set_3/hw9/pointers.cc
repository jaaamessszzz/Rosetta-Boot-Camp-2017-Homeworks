// In this exercise, you will be working with pointers.  There are only six lines of code
// that you will be writing, but in addition, you will need to explain what is happening to
// value pointed to by the "myint" pointer.
//
// Here are the lines of code you'll need to change.
// 1. Null pointer check; write code on this line to make sure that you do not try to access
// invalid memory addresses.  The "0" address is flagged as an invalid address, and if you
// try to de-reference a pointer (that is, to use the * operator ) when that pointer holds the
// value 0, then the program will segfault.
// 2. Memory allocation; write code on this line to create a new integer instance.
// 3. Function invocation on pointer objects; write code on this line to call the increment function
// on the inc1 pointer.
// 4. & 5. Same as 3, but for inc2 and inc3.
// 6. Memory deallocation; write code below this line to delete the four pieces of memory that
// were allocated inside of main.

// Run this program and give the value "10" when prompted.
// A. What is the value printed on the output line that starts with "END"?
// 12
// B. Where did that value come from?
// The input value "10" was assigned to memory at location myint. Every time Incrementer::increment was called where
// myint was passed in, 1 was added to the value held at myint.
// C. What does inc2 do?
// Since 0 was passed in as the value of intptr, it does nothing.
// Provide your answers here.
