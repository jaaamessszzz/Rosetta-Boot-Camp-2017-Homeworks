// You are writing a new video game to be played by 50-somethings
// on Facebook.  The player will accumulate pets and feed them
// and take them to get pedicures and to eat hand made rosemary and
// olive oil biscuis.  The players will pay small amounts of money 
// each day to keep their pets happy and affectionate.  You will
// be a billionare.

// But first you must write the game.

// All pets in this game will derive from a common base class, class Pet.
// This class will do a lot of work in keeping track of how much the pet
// has eaten, the quality of food that it has been given (the higher
// quality the food, the shinier its coat will be and the more affectionate
// the pet will become, and of course, the more the player will have to
// pay you for it).  You will derive a new pet, class TabbyCat, from Pet.

// Your class should *derive publicly* from class Pet.  In its *constructor*
// it should invoke the four initialization subroutines of the base class;
// set_initial_weight, set_ideal_adult_weight, set_age_of_adulthood,
// and set_metabolic_rate.  For a tabby cat, go with an initial weight of
// 0.5 lbs, an ideal adult weight of 12 lbs, an age of adulthood at 10 days
// (it's a video game), and a metabolic rate of 6 calories per hour per pound.
// The code already provided in main() should be used, though, you might want
// to play around with how much the tabby cat ought to be fed.


// HW12
// Now, with your base class (Pet) and your derived class (TabbyCat) in
// place, you will be adding a virtual function to the Pet class that you
// will also add to the TabbyCat class.
//
// Typically, pets also have a favorite food that they love eating. Add a
// private membrane variable favorite_food_ to the Pet class and initialize
// it in the constructor with "seeds". Add a public getter and setter (taking
// a string) to this class as well:
//
// virtual void set_favorite_food( std::string ); and
// std::string get_favorite_food();
//
// (What does the keyword "virtual" do?)
//
// This function is called in the "train_at_salad_bar" function (below), where
// players can pay $7.50 to feed their pets all the salad they can eat, and
// as a side effect, change the food preferences of their pets.  On a trip
// to the salad bar, their favorite food becomes spinach.
//
// Now with TabbyCats the thing is a bit different. Their evolutionary ties
// to tigers seem to be stronger than for other cats (after all, their fur
// resembles that of a tiger more closely) so they LOVE meat. They don't
// like seeds or spinach at all. To account for this, *override* the base class's
// implementation of the set_favorite_food method by adding a setter that has
// the same function signature as in the (parent) Pet class, but that instead
// of altering the favorite_food_ data member, prints out a big warning, saying
// something like you aren't allowed to set the favorite food for a TabbyCat,
// because the only thing they eat is meat.  Make sure to call the parent class's
// version of set_favorite_food( "meat" ) in the TabbyCat's constructor -- you'll
// have to figure out how to call the parent class's version of this function.
//
// What should happen when Snookums is sent to the salad bar?
