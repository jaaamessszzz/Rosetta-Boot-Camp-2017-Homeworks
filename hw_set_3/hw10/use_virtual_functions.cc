#include <vector> //HINT

// In this exercise, you will be using virtual functions.  In C++,
// classes “inherit” from each other – a “child class” has access to
// things it got from the “parent class” it was based on.  A key
// feature of this is “virtual functions” - functions which are
// defined with the same function signature for all members of the
// class family, but behave differently for each member of the class.
// (You should have heard about / read about virtual functions much
// more deeply than I can introduce here...but those are the basics).

// Inheritance lets you have a pointer of type class A, that points
// to an actual instantiated object of class B, where type B is a child
// class of type A.  This means that the class interface defined by A
// can be implemented differently by the child classes, but called with
// the same function call!

// The assignment is simple: I have supplied a class hierarchy for you
// of simple classes with a name and math function.  Your job is to
// call these classes' functions to produce output like so:

// (begin sample output)
// My name is class DOUBLER and my math operation on 6 returns 12.
// My name is class SQUARER and my math operation on 9 returns 81.
// …
// (end sample output)

// Repeat for all classes (doubler, squarer, cuber) and all integers
// 1-10.  Use a loop over the integers!  Megabonus points for using a
// loop over the CLASSES.  (This is possible but we haven't covered
// it.  Hint: instantiate instances of each class, then figure out how
// to put them in a container like std::vector or std::list that you
// can iterate over.)

//For now, feel free to skip to the top of int main(), and return to
//the class definitions as needed.
